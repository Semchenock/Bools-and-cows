# Bools-and-cows
This is simple game based on guessing number. I made that while learning how to interact with dom. 
## Here is some instructions how to play:
1. Open web page: https://semchenock.github.io/Bools-and-cows/
2. In the center you can find sign input, write down 3 didgit number here (each didgit must be unique) 
3. Click "ok" btn and read the message. If you input is correct computer will display how many "cows" and "bools" in entered number
4. Cows show us how many didgits of number that you guessed are equal to the didgits of number that computer guessed
5. Bools show us how many didgits of number that you guessed are equal and located in the same place as in the number that computer guessed
6. You can input new numbers that you think are correct
7. Keep guessing until you win
###Simple example
Computer generated: "123" (we cant see this number)
We guess: "402" 
Computer answer us: "0 bools, 1 cow", now we know that guessed number contains one of didgits (2 but we dont know it for sure)
We keep guessing: "142"
Computer answer us: "1 bools, 1 cow", now we know that guessed number contains two of didgits (1 and 2) and one of them is located in the same place
So we keep guessing based on results of privious guesses
###Some aditional functionality
1. "Again" btn resets the game without reseting hight score
2. Bns "3","4" and "5" are dificulties of game. Click one of them to change dificulty 
### Hope you enjoy it!
